		content:
			"I adore Fall Guys. Since launch, I've been playing the jellybean racing game almost daily and I've racked myself up a respectable number of wins. Getting a solid shot on goal in Fall Ball, watching others fall to their doom in See Saw, cutting someone off in Hex-A-Gone, it's all great fun and allows me to feel the adrenaline coursing through my veins. But now that it's been out for a while, it's becoming clear that a few things need to change. Fall Guys Season 2 was shown off at last night's Gamescom Opening Night Live, and now we know that we've got more costumes, stages, and falling to come in little over a month. This is all great news, but we also need changes to the existing content. As I said, I adore Fall Guys, but I'd be lying if I said there weren't a few minigames that make me groan or some small quality of life issues that bug me.",

			"More details surrounding Apple’s first ARM-based MacBook from its specs point-of-view have been shared once more. Previously, it was stated that the machine would sport a 12-inch display and would start from $799, making it one extremely competitive machine, especially one that’s being sold from Apple. Now, more internal hardware details surrounding the upcoming notebook have been shared, although you might find that there are similarities with the previous reports as well.",

		title: "iPhone 12 Will Reportedly Stick With the Same 12MP Camera ",
		content:
			"Apple has stuck with the 12MP resolution ever since the iPhone 6s’ inception back in 2015. While we’re not entirely sure what the company’s reasoning is for sticking with a 12MP sensor, according to a tipster, it looks as if history will be repeating itself as far as camera resolutions go for the iPhone 12, but there is going to be a slight twist in the story. According to the tipster Komiya, if Apple is sticking with the same 12MP dual and triple camera array for different iPhone 12 models, one major change is that these sensors will receive a spec bump in terms of size. While it’s not confirmed whom Apple will tap to source these sensors from, the advantages of having a bigger sensor in a smartphone are plentiful. Most importantly, it allows for more light to be captured by the sensor, so the image looks thoroughly crisp.",

		title: "Immortal Realms: Vampire Wars Review – Pick a Card and Pray",
		content:
			"A land ruled by vampires doesn't sound like a land any regular human would want to live in: getting worked to the bone to satisfy these immortal masters only to get discarded later on is hardly the recipe of a happy and prosperous life. However, things are not always so grim, judging from Immortal Realms: Vampire Wars, a strategy game that does a lot of things right and tries to spice up the traditional strategy game experience with some unique mechanics that work surprisingly well. Immortal Realms: Vampire Wars features different story campaigns centered on different Vampire tribes - the Dracul, who rule over the lands of Warmont since time immemorial, the corrupt and vicious Nosfernus who hails from the Land of the Dead and the mysterious Moroia, from the frozen lands in the North. All three tribes have their own woes and trials to deal with, which they will during their specific campaigns",
